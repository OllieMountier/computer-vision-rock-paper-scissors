# computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors

Milestone 2 was my first introduction to using models. On teachable machine I created model ready to use in my RPS project that contained 4 classes- Rock, Paper, Scissors
and nothing. I then added 4 or 5 pictures into each class of what the camera should recognise to be each gesture. I used more than one image as it allowed me to "train"
the model better and make its predictions more accurate down the line.
I then downloaded the models file which contained keras_model.h5 (the model itself) and a text file that contained the labels (classes) of the model called labels.txt.
